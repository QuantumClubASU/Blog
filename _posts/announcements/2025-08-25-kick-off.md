 Kick off the fall semester with the ASU Quantum Club! ⚛️ Our first meeting is this Wednesday, August 28th at 6 PM at PSF 123.

We're excited to announce two incredible invited speakers: [Professor Christian Arenz](https://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/christianarenz/principle-investigator/) and [Professor Aviral Shrivastava](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/mps-lab/person/aviral-shrivastava/). 👨‍🏫 They'll be sharing their insights on the latest in quantum information science.

Come for the quantum, stay for the pizza! 🍕 We can't wait to see you there! 👋.
